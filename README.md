We're always running out of time
(She's always running out of time)
I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
(She's always running out of time)
Out of time
Always running out of time
Sanity
winwin

Said I was gonna take some flowers to my neighbor
But I ran out of time
Didn't wanna show up to the party empty-handed
But I ran out of time
Said I'll walk the dog a little further than the driveway tonight
The extra mile
Thought I'd send a card with my condolences
But damn I just ran out of time
Intentions only get you so far
What if I'm just a selfish prick?
No regard
I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
Nevermind I just hit the snooze on my alarm twenty times
I was just so tired
There was traffic, spilled my coffee, crashed my car
Otherwise woulda been here on time
Shoulda, coulda, wouldn't matter
Ultimate alibi
You know it's a lie
There was a fire! (metaphorically)
Be there in 5! (hyperbolically)
Intentions only get you so far
(It was on my list I swear I meant to get to it)
A harsh reality to discover
I'm always running out of time
(She's always running out of time)
I'm always running out of time
Why we gotta be in a rush?
My watch is just for decoration
Look I showed up early for once
Now that's a new sensation
We're always running out of time
(She's always running out of time)
I'm always running out of time
I'm always running out of time
(She's always running out of time)
Out of time
Always running out of time


Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
